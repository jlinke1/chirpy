# chirpy
This project was build following the boot.dev Learn Webservers course.
It is a basic Twitter/X clone.

## Why I wrote it 
I followed the course and built this project to learn more about Backend Engineering.
Especially about Go and how to built web servers.

## ⚙️ Installation 
`go install github.com/jlinke1/chirpy@latest`

## 🚀 Running
Run `chirpy` to start the server.

Use `--debug` to start the server in debug mode (currently this only removes the db file, so you start with a fresh db).

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8080/app to see the index page.

## 📖 Documentation
still need to document all the endpoints here.
